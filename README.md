# 👋 Assalamu Alaikum, I’m Shaeel

🚀 Software Engineering Student | 🌍 Builder | 🧠 Curious Mind  

I’m a software engineering student who loves turning ideas into real, useful products.  
I’m big on **clean code**, **learning by building**, and using tech as a force for good.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Web development  
- Real-world projects  
- Research-driven thinking  
- Long-term impact over short-term hype

## 🛠 What I Work With

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React (learning & building)  
- **Backend & Tools:** Supabase, Node.js  
- **Other Interests:** Research, product thinking, business ideas  

I believe skills compound — small effort daily, big results over time 📈

## 🌍 Featured Project

### **GlobeTrek**
🧭 A travel journaling platform where users:
- Document trips and experiences

## 🧠 Mindset

- Build first, perfect later  
- Learn deeply, not just fast  
- Stay humble, stay consistent  
- Intention matters — **niyyah before action**

I see technology through a values-based lens:  
**If it doesn’t benefit people, it’s not worth scaling.**
